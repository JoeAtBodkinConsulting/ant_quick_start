Instructions:
Put this file in an empty directory and run the 'ant' command in that directory. The build file will create directories and make a very empty jar file in the same directory as the build.xml.

Create src/HW.java and put this code in it.

public class HW
{
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }

}

in the build file below change  
<property name="main_class_name" value="changeme"/> 
to 
<property name="main_class_name" value="HW"/>
 
Run the ant command again, and now you can run your main class with the command
java -jar antsimple.jar

It should print:
Hellow World
and exit.

Add a junit.jar (from junit.org) into your ANT_HOME/lib directory and run 'ant test'
 
Create the file test/HWTest.java and add this code.
import junit.framework.*;
public class HWTest extends TestCase {
    public void testTrue()
    {
        assertTrue(true);
    }
}
